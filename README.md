## Hi ðŸ‘‹

  Iâ€™m Aymen, a recent chemical engineering grad
  I like Python, linux and open source, and write code of varying degrees of quality
  I'm currently trying to learn more about robotics and ML ðŸ¤–
  I also like to write about maths and engineering related things on [my blog](https://aymenhafeez.github.io/)
